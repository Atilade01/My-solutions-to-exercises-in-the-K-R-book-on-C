# My-solutions-to-exercises-in-the-K-R-book-on-C

This repository contains my solutions to some of the programming execrises in Dennis Ritchie's 'The C Programming Language 2nd ed'.
Unlike other solutions I have seen so far, mine are done based on the 'current' level of knowledge. That means if a discussion on pointers is not done in the book till chapter 5 of the textbook, then I do not apply pointers when writing solutions to the exercises in previous chapters (i.e, chapters 1-4).
I believe this is the intention of the authors too. I do not think they expect that a concept saved for a later chapter is used by the reader in a preceeding chapter.
